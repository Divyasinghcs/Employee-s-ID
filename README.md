Hey guys!!!
My name is Divya Singh. 
Currently, pursuing B.E degree in Information Technology from University Institute of Technology,Burdwan.
This project is on React app.
I used node.js for creating this react app.
I used React-Router for switching web page.
I fetch 10 random user ID's using randomUser API.
--------------------------------------------------------------
App.js = Here i used router to switch between home and user details page.
Home.js = Here I fetch 10 random users using randomUser API and list it and passed every user to UserDetail.js using map function.
UserDetail.js = Here i collected user using uselocation and fetch details like first name, last name, age, gender, location, & email address,image and displayed it.
I used my innovative thinking to give the web page a simple yet classy look using the concepts of HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
